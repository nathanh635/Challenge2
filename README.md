Module 2 Challenge

Here's the link to the portfolio webpage: https://nathanh635.github.io/Challenge2/

The navigation bar links at the top bring you down to the sections below, and the contact links for email and Github will bring you to the respective locations. 

The background image is just a screenshot of the code for the page. 

More projects will be added under the project page as the course continues. Currently the one that is there is a practice project I was working on.


When on a large device, the main body appears as two columns, The left side with titles and the right side with the content. On smaller devices, the body switches to a column view, showing titles and content in several rows in one column.

Notes:

-currently I haven't actually made the Resume link lead anywhere. However, the email contact, Github, and other project links are both functional.
-it doesn't look quite as fancy as I want it to, but it's functional and the page sizes appropriately now, so thats a victory!
